Welcome to the site for my Jekyll theme. This theme is:

 * Easy to configure:
     - All colours, sizes and fonts configured from `main.scss` via variables.
     - Only 4 base colours to change, easy to flip to light theme.
     - Most sizes are calculated off a single base value.
     - Heavily commented making reasons for each bit of CSS obvious.

 * Easy to understand:
     - Familiarity with CSS and SCSS not required, should be intuitive to any programmer.
     - Non-obvious markup has explanations.

 * Favours function over style.
     - Supports all window sizes
     - Paragraph text is restricted to a maximum width to maintain readability.
     - Code is given a much wider space.
     - Flows and squashes to small displays without horizontal scroll bars.

The motivation was the fact that all the themes that I've seen so far were far too difficult to decipher and edit predictably.
I have not kept up with the way websites are made over the last 10 years, I had no idea what SCSS is.

I attempted to start from scratch using `jekyll new` and discovered the default theme was also disturbingly complex.
I stripped out anything without an obvious or necessary purpose and built this theme.

I won't accept having markup or code I don't understand, I'm not keen on building my site on poor foundations.
