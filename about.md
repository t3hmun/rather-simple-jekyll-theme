Hello welcome to my super simple basic theme that can be understood by those who have not kept up tp date with web development for the last 10 years. As long as you have a basic comprehension of HTML and programming in genereal, you should be able to understand my theme. 

Every single Jekyll theme that I have come across so far has been stuffed full of impossible to decipher Javascript, CSS and other things. Extremely difficult to reverse engineer and modify to my own satisfaction.

My aim with this theme is to create a truly simple base theme, while embracing the new technologies that make web development easier.
