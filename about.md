Welcome to the site for my Jekyll theme. This theme is:

 * Easy to configure:
     - All colours, sizes and fonts configured from `main.scss` via variables.
     - Most sizes are calculated off eachother, so changing one size affects all.
     - Heavily commented making reasons for each bit of CSS obvious.
 * Easy to understand:
     - Familiarity with CSS and SCSS not required, should be intuitive to any programmer.
     - Non-obvious markup has explanations.
 * Favours function over style:
     - Supports all window sizes
     - Text is restricted to a maximum width to maintain readability.

The motivation was the fact that all the themes that I've seen so far were far too difficult to decipher and edit predictably.
I have not kept up with the way waubsites are made over the last 10 years.
Didnt even know what SCSS is.
Even the default `jekyll new` site seemed overcomplicated, so I decided to build up from a basic shell of markup that I fully understand.
I'm trying to comment in a way that allows anyone in a similar position to hit the ground running.
I wont't accept having markup or code I don't understand, I'm not keen on building my site on poor foundations.
