# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

Not a particulary large heading. `Heading 1` is not really meant to be used at all. It is used for the post title, which is automatically inserted by Jekyll.

Here is some code:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> This is a random code block to test the functionality.
```

I'm sure you enjoyed that code. Now have a blockquote:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> > Embedded blockquote.
>
> Back to the original blockquote.

Now a normal paragraph of text is what this is, well it would be normal if it was not composed of a single rambling sentence that was spewed forth in a single typing frenzy.
