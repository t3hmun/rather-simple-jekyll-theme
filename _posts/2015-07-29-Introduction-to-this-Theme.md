## Motivation

Hello welcome to my super simple basic theme that can be understood by those who have not kept up tp date with web development for the last 10 years. As long as you have a basic comprehension of HTML and programming in genereal, you should be able to understand my theme. 

Every single Jekyll theme that I have come across so far has been stuffed full of impossible to decipher Javascript, CSS and other things. Extremely difficult to reverse engineer and modify to my own satisfaction.

My aim with this theme is to create a truly simple base theme, while embracing the new technologies that make web development easier.

## Use of technologies

For a start I'm obviously making use of Jekyll. I've decided not to bother using the standard GitHub-Pages configuration of Jekyll. Personally I find it makes much more sense to generate the site locally, since it'll be tested locally anyway. This way I can use whatever versions and combinations of tooling that I feel like. GitHub pages would just be another potential source of bugs.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
