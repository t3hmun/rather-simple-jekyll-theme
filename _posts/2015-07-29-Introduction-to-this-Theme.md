## Installation

I am not using `gem gh-pages`. Keeping things synchronised with GitHub compatible versions just seems like an unnecessary limitation, I'll always have access to a machine that can build my site. So I just grabbed the latest stable version of Jekyll and Rouge.

``` bash
gem install jekyll -v 2.5.3
gem install rouge -v 1.9.1
```
