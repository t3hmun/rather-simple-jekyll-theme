Read more on the about page.

 * All fonts, colours and sizes are configured using variables in `main.css` making basic changes rather straight forward.
 
 * Only 4 colours to change if you want to change to a light theme.

 * Adjusts to all screen sizes without using media queries
  * Responsive sites are over-complicated for a blog, its hard to have consistent content with large layout changes.
  * The maintenance of responsive CSS isn't pleasant. 
  * If you avoid having sidebars, simple HTML is all you need.
 
 * No Javascript (It does use google fonts though, does that have scripts? TODO)
  

# Current status:

* [03/08/2015]  Version 1 released. It is ready for use.

Timescale for large updates is uncertain.
I will deliver small fixes quickly though.
