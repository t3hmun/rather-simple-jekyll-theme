## SASS extension to CSS

One may notice that most sizes and colours are set using variables.
These variables are a feature of SASS.
The values for these variables are all defined in the `main.scss` file.
SASS is an extension of CSS that outputs into CSS.
CSS tends to get ridiculously oversized and complicated these days.
SASS lets us abstract away a lot of this with variables and a bunch of other features.


## Margin VS Padding

Margins can overlap (only vertically in block elements) and are external to the element.
Paddings do not overlap and are internal to the element.
As a result margins only ensure a minimum distance between two elements.
So if 2 elements have a 10px and 15px margin respectively, the gap between them would be 15px.
If padding was used instead the gap would be 25 px.


## Inline Elements vs Block Elements

 * Inline elements appear within the normal flow of a sentence.
 * They are positioned by text alignment.
 * Most inline elements are just tags that format text (like <b>).
 * Their size is generally defined by their content.

 * Block elements are not affected by alignment.
 * Unless their size is defined they fill all available free space.
 * Positioned using their margins.
 * They can be made floating...

CSS can be used to change a block to a inline and vice versa, but this tends to get messy.
