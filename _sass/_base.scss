# Margin VS Padding

Margins can overlap (only vertically in block elements) and are external to the element. 
Paddings do not overlap and are internal to the element. 
As a result margins only ensure a minimum distance between two elements. 
So if 2 elements have a 10px and 15px margin respectively, the gap between them would be 15px. 
If padding was used instead the gap would be 25 px.
